    <section id="sec2"><p>My favourite hobby is coding.I love making apps,games,websites and etc.Coding is basically the computer language used to develop apps, websites, and software. Without it, we'd have none of the most popular technology we've come to rely on such as Facebook, our smartphones, the browser we choose to view our favorite blogs, or even the blogs themselves. It all runs on code.I enjoy coding and i want to learn more so that i can build apps which can help people and make their work easier and also build eudcational games which can make our         general knowledge more better </p> </section>
